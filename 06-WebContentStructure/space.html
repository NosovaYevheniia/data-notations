        shows the proposals put forth by multiple organizations and space agencies in this field of space exploration. These plans 
        have varied—from scientific expeditions, in which a small group (between two and eight astronauts) would visit Mars for a 
        period of a few weeks or more, to a continuous presence (e.g. through research stations, colonization, or other continuous 
        habitation).[citation needed] Some have also considered exploring the Martian moons Phobos and Deimos. By 2020, virtual 
        visits to Mars, using haptic technology, had also been proposed.
        
        Meanwhile, uncrewed exploration of Mars has been a goal of national space programs for decades, and was first achieved in 
        1965 with the Mariner 4 flyby. Human missions to Mars have been part of science fiction since the 1880s, and more broadly, 
        in fiction, Mars is a frequent target of exploration and settlement in books, graphic novels, and films. The concept of a 
        Martian as something living on Mars is part of the fiction. Proposals for human missions to Mars have come from agencies 
        such as NASA, CNSA, the European Space Agency, Boeing, SpaceX, and space advocacy groups such as the Mars Society and The 
        Planetary Society.</p>
